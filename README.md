## FINAL PROJECT
Title - Big Mart Sales Data Analysis
The project aims to analyze sales data from Big Mart to uncover key insights,extract meaningful information, and interpret findings to guide stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

Problem Statement :

Big Mart is a chain of retail outlets aiming to maximize its sales and profitability.The management has collected detailed data from 2013 on 1,559 products sold across 10 different stores in various cities. The dataset includes attributes related to the products, the outlets, and their sales performance.

The key objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze sales trends and patterns across different products and stores.
2. To build a predictive model that estimates the outlet sales based on its characteristics and store attributes.
3. To Cluster the Outlet based on 'Weight', 'ProductVisibility', 'MRP'.
4. To identify key factors influencing sales performance to assist in strategic decision-making.

Data Dictionary:
1. Item_Identifier: Unique product ID
2. Item_Weight: Weight of the product
3. Item_Fat_Content: Indicates whether the product is low fat or not
4. Item_Visibility: % of the total display area of all products in a store allocated to this product
5. Item_Type: Category of the product
6. Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
7. Outlet_Identifier: Unique store ID
8. Outlet_Establishment_Year: The year in which the store was established
9. Outlet_Size: Size of the store (e.g., Small, Medium, Large)
10.Outlet_Location_Type: Type of city where the store is located (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
11.Outlet_Type: Indicates the type of store (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket Type 1/2/3)
12.Item_Outlet_Sales: Total sales of the product in a particular store (Target variable in the train dataset)

Tools and Technologies:

• Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used:

• pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing
• matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
• statsmodels for statistical analysis
• sklearn for predictive modeling
